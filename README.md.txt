Online Banking System
Project Overview
The Online Banking System is a simple console-based Python application that allows users to perform basic banking operations. These operations include registering an account, logging in, checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and transferring money between accounts. The system uses a file-based approach to persist user data.

Features
User Registration: New users can create an account by providing a unique username and password.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their username and password to access their account.
Account Operations:
Check Balance: Users can check their current balance.
Deposit Funds: Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their account.
Transfer Funds: Users can transfer money to another registered user’s account.
File-based Storage: User information (username, password, and balance) is stored in a text file to persist data across sessions.
Installation
Clone or Download the repository.
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. The application doesn’t require any third-party libraries, as it uses built-in Python modules.
Run the Program:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have saved the project.
Run the command python banking_system.py to start the application.
Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu of options:

Register: You can create a new account by entering a unique username and password.
Login: Log into your existing account using your credentials.
Operations: Once logged in, you can:
Check your balance.
Deposit money into your account.
Withdraw money from your account.
Transfer money to another registered user.
Logout: You can log out at any time to end your session.
Example Flow:
Register a new account.
Log in with your username and password.
Check your balance.
Deposit funds into your account.
Withdraw or transfer money.
Logout when done.
File Structure
users.txt: This file is used to store user information, including usernames, passwords, and balances. Each line in the file represents one user’s data, separated by commas.
How Data is Stored
The user data is stored in a simple text file (users.txt), where each user’s information is represented as:

Copy
username,password,balance
Data Persistence:
When users perform actions like depositing or withdrawing money, their updated balance is saved to the users.txt file, ensuring the data persists across sessions.
Limitations & Future Improvements
Limitations:
Basic File Storage: Currently, the system uses a text file for storing user data, which is not secure and not suitable for large-scale applications.
Security: Passwords are stored in plain text, which is insecure. A more secure approach would involve hashing passwords and encrypting sensitive data.
No Real-Time Transaction Processing: This is a basic system without features like real-time transaction validation, email notifications, or two-factor authentication (2FA).
Future Improvements:
Database Integration: Implement a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for more efficient and secure data storage.
Password Hashing: Use encryption techniques like bcrypt to securely hash passwords.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI for better user interaction, potentially using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
Web Application: Convert the system into a web-based application using frameworks like Flask or Django.
